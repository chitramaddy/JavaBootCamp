1. What was the most difficult part of this model?

Understanding the relationships between tables was very challenging. We tried imagining real time scenarios. Need more practice resolving many-to-many relationships.


2. What change along the way presented the biggest challenge?

Also, converting our idea to the drawing was challenging.


3. How difficult or easy was it to change your model midstream?

We did not have difficulty adding new model.

4. Where there any columns on which your team didn't agree on a data type?

We agreed on the datatypes.
